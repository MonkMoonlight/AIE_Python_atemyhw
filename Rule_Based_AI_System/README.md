# Rule-Based AI Project Ideas

This project explores simple AI systems built with rules or heuristics, as AI was commonly done before modern machine learning. Below are some potential project ideas.

---

## Project Ideas

### 1. Restaurant Recommendation Chatbot
- **What it does**: A chatbot that suggests restaurants based on user preferences (cuisine, budget, location).
- **How it works with rules**: Matches keywords from input against a rule set.  
  Example: *If cuisine = Italian AND budget = low → suggest Pizza Palace.*

---

### 2. Medical Symptom Checker (Diagnostic Tool)
- **What it does**: A diagnostic system where a user enters symptoms, and the AI suggests possible conditions.
- **How it works with rules**: Uses rules like:  
  *If fever AND cough AND sore throat → possible flu.*

---

### 3. Tech Support Troubleshooter
- **What it does**: A helpdesk-style system that walks users through common computer/software issues.
- **How it works with rules**: Follows decision-tree logic:  
  *If computer won’t turn on → check power cable.  
  If screen is blank but fans running → check monitor connection.*

## My Choice
I chose the **Tech Support Troubleshooter** because it has a clear decision-tree structure that demonstrates the essence of rule-based AI. It’s practical, interactive, and engaging to test with different scenarios.

## Running the Project
This repo will include Python code to implement the chosen rule-based system. To run it:

```bash
python main.py
